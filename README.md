## A little about me:
My name is Tomer Horowitz and i'm a software engineer from israel, i've started working for a local software company when I was 16 and started attending uni at 18.

I am a certified `TensorFlow` developer (see certification below).

## I am mostly intrested in: 
1. Machine learning, data science and all the math behind it.
2. Creating libraries that others can use.
3. Creatively design websites (I like following google's material design guidelines).

## Projects worth checking of mine:
1. [GeneticFlow](https://github.com/tomergt45/GeneticFlow)
